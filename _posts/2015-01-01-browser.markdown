A browser is an application that makes _requests_ to servers for website contents. When the server sends a _response_ the browser draws the elements and BOOM, what you see is a website.

The term _modern browser_ refers to those which support more of the current web standards developed byt he W3C.

A few browser options: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
